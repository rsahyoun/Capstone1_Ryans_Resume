            <ul>
                <li>
                    At In-N-Out, I provide great service while taking customer orders, preparing <br />
                    food, and ensuring the restaurant remained clean and tidy at all times. <br />

            <ul>
                <li>
                    During this internship I preformed updates and changes to the Frontend <br />
                    UI of the company as well as do module updates. I generated receipts <br />
                    and processed them through the payroll software. Finished setting up the WSL <br />
                    build process for the frontend and the backend projects. As well as participate <br />
                    in scrum project development. For all these tasks that I preformed at Runa, <br />
                    I used Javascript, React, and Ruby on Rails active records. My knowledge on how <br />
                    a company operates was expanded and I know now how a tech team is able to <br />
                    communicate with each other as well as get all the required tasks done in a given time. <br />
